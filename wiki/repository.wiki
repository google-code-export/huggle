=== Repository rules ===
Before you make a commit to trunk make sure it works, please do not commit changes which are work in progress and not compileable, for that use own branch. If you see someone's change which doesn't work, comment it out and contact the person who's responsible for it, do this only in case that you can't compile or use program.

Use comments everywhere possible.

=== Standards ===
All code should be compileable in visual c#, code is written in the philophy that stability > performance > style.

Every function should have look similar to this:

<code language="c">string MyFunction(string parameter)
{
  // what is it
  Core.History("Class.MyFunction()");
  ...
}
Every class should look like:

class Class
{ //explanation
   public string blah; //variables
   public string name
   { get { return ""; } } // properties
   public string foo() // functions
}
}</code>

if you see that someone did anything wrong fix it yourself isntead of notifiing them, if you don't understand any function, use '''//comment needed''' anywhere you want
