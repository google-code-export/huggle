=== WebKit in Huggle 3 (using Awesomium) ===

++ About Awesomium ++

Awesomium is a Web-Browser-Framework which based on Chromium/WebKit.
The API is available for .NET/Mono and C.

The current version is 1.6.4.

++ Why Awesomium/WebKit??? ++

The WebBrowser-Component which we have used in Huggle 2 is only a Wrapper around the IE ActiveX control.
And how we all know, the IE is slowly...
Moreover the component isn't available on Mac with Mono.

So I searched for a component, which is platform independent (Mono and .NET) and faster than IE.

++ How will Awesomium implement in Huggle 3? ++

It will implement it into Huggle as a class. The class has only got an function for navigating to an url.
But theres one problem:
The component from Awesomium I will implement in the class isn't yet available for Mono.
The developer of Awesomium will release the component with Awesomium 1.7.

So: What should we do until Awesomium 1.7?
